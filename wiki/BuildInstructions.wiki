This page explains how you can build your own copy of the Notepas binary from the svn sources.

The instructions below show how to build NotePas on a Windows machine but you can also build it on a Linux or Mac OS X machine.

First you need to install the Lazarus IDE. In this example I use version 1.2.2 of the IDE but any later version should do fine.

Because the code uses some new language features which are not yet supported in the FPC compiler shipped with Lazarus (version 2.6.4) you will need to download FPC version 2.7.1, which can be found here:
