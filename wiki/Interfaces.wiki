#summary An overview of the main interfaces

The main architecture of Notepas relies heavily on interfaces to achieve loose coupling of the key modules.

All the interfaces are declared in the {{{ts.Editor.Interfaces}}} unit. Instances of the key modules supporting those interfaces are created using factories, to reduce dependencies.
